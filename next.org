- Learning to drive CuBLAS is now a first-class goal

- I feel like your post rn punts on the question of “what should the
  kernel itself be responsible for and what should its caller”? Like
  you should face head-on in your post the question of “can the kernel
  just get passed all the necessary layouts?”

- Do some matmuls with…
  - Your kernels
  - Cutlass-w-template kernels
  - CuBLAS
- …and see what numbers you get compared to the ones you make from the
  template args (getting better at both ncu and cutlass 2.0)

- You should just have the kernels. Tests separately invoke, test

- You need to more directly understand:
    - “Causal”
    - “Masking”

- Rebase it now

- Add stuff about copies

- Your post (maybe moreso the accompanying video) should dive deeper
  into the FA2 repo, talk about what it's doing and why
