- Do some matmuls with hand-rolled kernels in CuTe and see what
  numbers you get compared to the ones you make from the template args
  (getting better at both ncu and cutlass 2.0)

- Hack together the blog post, publish it

- Maybe *separately* make tests for matmuls to test against cpu, to
  separate test logic from code

- retile_D, what is that?
